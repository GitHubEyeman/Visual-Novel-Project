While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 80, in script
    a thinking "I'm your best friend. I know everything that you think. Either way. Goodluck on finding that person. Not everyone is good at asking for help."
Exception: Say has image attributes ('thinking',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
